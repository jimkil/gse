# Greenbone Vulnerability Manager 20.08.0 Source Code Edition Installation script

## Bash script automating the installation of Greenbone Vulnerability Manager 20.08.0 on Debian 10

Installation will be located in /usr/local/, which is the default for GVM SCE.

### Design principles:
  - Dedicated to GVM, nothing else
  - Use the defaults where possible
  - Least access

During installation a GVM user called 'admin' is created. The generated password for User admin is
stored in the file /usr/local/var/lib/adminuser. It is recommended that this password is changed and/or
the file deleted. Do NOT delete the user admin unless you also change the feedowner to another user.

A BIG Thank You to Greenbone Networks GmbH for supporting the security community, especially Bj√∂rn Ricks (https://twitter.com/BjoernRicks).

### Known issues:
  - ospd-openvas running as root (it needs that for openvas scanning) however that should be changed to a specific account
  - openvas-smb throws some errors at compile time - need to investigate
  - Not tested with separate scanner systems


All feedback is welcome and the plan is to maintain this one, contrary to the older version using GVM11
